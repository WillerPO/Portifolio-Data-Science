Hi everybody!

Credit risk assessment and loan management are critical global issues that deeply affect financial institutions. Many banks have been automating their loan approval processes for years using data science and machine learning to make them more efficient and reduce their bad debt losses. Using predictive modeling techniques can streamline the loan origination process, improve credit recovery processes, and reduce bias in financing decisions.

To contribute to this important process of change, I used various statistical tools and machine learning algorithms to predict, as accurately as possible, the likelihood that a borrower will default on home loans.

I tested three different Machine Learning models (one linear model: Logistic Regression, and two non-linear ones: Decision Tree and Random Forest), comparing them through several performance metrics, to define which one would be the most suitable for this task.

I hope this usage example can help you to implement your machine learning models to your dataset.

Enjoy it!
